Yes, BLINKS! I recorded it as it came on HBO this past weekend and when I saw this I literally had to replay it several times, focusing on one eye at a time to make sure that I was not seeing things! Of course, after that, it was hard to take the movie seriously although there were a few interesting and intense scenes with Julian Sands. Very disappointed and give it a 4 mostly due to the fact that the 1st victim blinks in one of the last frames as the camera pulls away from the body/face. Too bad.\",\n          \"If this film was just outrageously poor would be fine, the problem is many take it seriously. To make it short, a few points: <br /><br />- There is no story, no focus, no lead whatsoever and all the questions raised fail to find an answer. Overall, the film is extremely repetitive and boring (I have been in war-torn African countries several times and found all the lingering on local misery and hopelessness very painful to watch but still having no sense).<br /><br />- Questions raised are pure manipulation and the truth is that they are no questions but statements.<br /><br />- I am no doc filmmaker, but what's the point in raising, for example, the question of weapon smuggling, if the only element brought to the audience is a local reporter's statement? The director doesn't even bother showing us at least a sequence where he would be waiting near the airport trying to spot heavily loaded trucks leaving the area right after a plane landed.<br /><br />- The story of the fish takes up less than 5 mn, and is only supported by a sequence where the director films a documentary shown during a local conference. Did this guy do any work at all???? <br /><br />- Abject poverty is shown all the time in endless sequences but where's the point? One can go almost anywhere in Africa with a hand cam and shoot the same images unfortunately. Where's the big news? <br /><br />- Filming the prostitutes watching and crying over images of their assassinated friend and fellow prostitute is worth the worst emotional manipulations one can see these days on thrash and real TV.<br /><br />- The parallel drawn between the famine devastating the country with over two million starving and the exportation of fish is absolutely pointless, dishonest and makes no sense but to manipulate viewers in typically anti-globalization and anti-western feelings.<br /><br />There is an interesting debate in France after an academic published a very detailed comment on the film, which brought number of journalists working in Africa for decades to investigate a bit further about several details. It turns out that: <br /><br />- The fish waste shown drying in the sun and collected by some local people is not at all meant to be eaten by human beings but is collected to be exported for reasonably good money for animal-feeding purposes. I think I am not the only one having had the impression that the director suggested the exact opposite.<br /><br />- Arm smuggling is a reality (but there again, where's the big news??), but not the way this film explains the issue. If the empty planes landing in Mwanza do participate in smuggling, they actually unload their shipment in a different location in Africa, then go to Mwanza to pick up fish in order not to make the trip back empty (meaning that they do actually land empty in Mwanza...).<br /><br />- People do eat fish locally, contrary to what the film suggest (around 40-60% of what is taken out of the lake) and thousands of people make their living with it. Good for them! It's private business of that kind that will one day take African countries out of poverty and not western moaning and endless foreign assistance.<br /><br />I cannot tell how shocked I am seeing the success of this film!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# corpus=말뭉치: NL 연구를 위해 특정한 목적을 가지고 언어의 표본을 추출한 집합\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords # 불용어(stopwords) 사전 가져옴\n","import nltk"],"metadata":{"id":"NE3MgM_y1S7l","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713487646403,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":1649,"user":{"displayName":"조유빈","userId":"11504176595513925899"}}},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["nltk.download('stopwords')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"rUp_x0AA2ODP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713487646403,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"조유빈","userId":"11504176595513925899"}},"outputId":"83b7cbb2-a141-40cc-fd84-a868fbd4eda2"},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping corpora/stopwords.zip.\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["True"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["set_stopwords = set(stopwords.words('english')) # 영어로된 불용어 가져와 집합으로 구성"],"metadata":{"id":"GfMAud-_3B-l","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713487646403,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"조유빈","userId":"11504176595513925899"}}},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 리뷰글 받아서 쓸데없는 부분 없애는 함수\n","def preprocessing(review, remove_stopwords = True):\n","    review_text = BeautifulSoup(review, 'html5lib').get_text(separator=' ') # html 태그 제거\n","    review_text = re.sub('[^a-zA-Z]', ' ', review_text) # a-z, A-Z 제외하고(^) 전부 다 ' '(공백)으로 대체(substitute)\n","\n","    # 불용어 제거\n","    if remove_stopwords:\n","        words = review_text.split() # 단어들로 쪼개 words 리스트에 넣어줌\n","        words = [w for w in words if not w in set_stopwords]\n","\n","        review_text = ' '.join(words) # join: 리스트의 원소들 전부 다 붙여줌 (' '을 사이에 두고)\n","\n","    review_text = review_text.lower() # 대소문자 비교는 감정판단과 관련 없으므로 대문자를 모두 소문자로 변경\n","\n","    return review_text"],"metadata":{"id":"XXzScs-E3CvR","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713488696408,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":356,"user":{"displayName":"조유빈","userId":"11504176595513925899"}}},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["list_reviews = list(imdb_pd['review'])\n","print(list_reviews[0])\n","print(preprocessing(list_reviews[0], False))\n","print(preprocessing(list_reviews[0]))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"nGAXPqiV47vP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713488715925,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":281,"user":{"displayName":"조유빈","userId":"11504176595513925899"}},"outputId":"72667623-d2e9-4395-a38d-3a239aa4f601"},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["... for Paris is a moveable feast.\" Ernest Hemingway<br /><br />It is impossible to count how many great talents have immortalized Paris in paintings, novels, songs, poems, short but unforgettable quotes, and yes - movies. The celebrated film director Max Ophüls said about Paris, <br /><br />\"It offered the shining wet boulevards under the street lights, breakfast in Montmartre with cognac in your glass, coffee and lukewarm brioche, gigolos and prostitutes at night. Everyone in the world has two fatherlands: his own and Paris.\" <br /><br />Paris is always associated with love and romance, and \"Paris, Je T'Aime\" which is subtitled \"Petite romances,\" is a collection of short films, often sketches from 18 talented directors from all over the world. In each, we become familiar with one of the City of Light 20 arrondissements and with the Parisians of all ages, genders, colors, and backgrounds who all deal in love in its many variations and stages. In some of the \"petite romances\" we are the witnesses of the unexpected encounters of the strangers that lead to instant interest, closeness, and perhaps relationship: like for Podalydès and Florence Muller in the street of Montmartre in the opening film or for Cyril Descours and Leïla Bekhti as a white boy and a Muslim girl whose cross-cultural romance directed by Gurinder Chadha begins on Quais de Seine. I would include into this category the humorous short film by Gus Van Sant. In \"Le Marais\" one boy pours his heart out to another boy confessing of sudden unexpected closeness, asking permission to call - never realizing that the object of his interest does not understand French.<br /><br />Some of the vignettes are poignant and even dark. In Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas' Loin du 16ème, Catalina Sandino Mareno (amazing Oscar nominated debut for Maria full of Grace) is single, working-class mother who has to work as a nanny in a wealthy neighborhood to pay for daycare where she drops her baby every morning before she goes to work. One of most memorable and truly heartbreaking films is \"Place des Fêtes\" by Oliver Schmitz. Aïssa Maïga and Seydou Boro co-star as two young people for who love could have happened. There were the promises of it but it was cut short due to hatred and intolerance that are present everywhere, and the City of Love and Light is no exception. Another one that really got to me was \"Bastille\", written and directed by Isabel Coixet, starring Sergio Castellitto, Miranda Richardson, and Leonor Watling. Castellitto has fallen out of love with his wife, Richardson but when he is ready to leave with the beautiful mistress, the devastating news from his wife's doctor arrives...<br /><br />I can go on reflecting on all 18 small gems. I like some of them very much. The others felt weak and perhaps will be forgotten soon but overall, I am very glad that I bought the DVD and I know that I will return to my favorite films again and again. They are \"Place des Fêtes\" that I've mentioned already, \"Père-Lachaise\" directed by Wes Craven that involves the ghost of one of the wittiest and cleverest men ever, Oscar Wilde (Alexander Payne, the director of \"Sideways\") who would save one troubled relationship. Payne also directed \"14th Arrondissement\" in which a lonely middle-aged post-worker from Denver, CO explores the city on her own providing the voice over in French with the heavy accent. Payne's entry is one of the most moving and along with hilarious \"Tuileries\" by Joel and Ethan Coen with (who else? :)) Steve Buschemi is my absolute favorite. In both shorts, American tourists sit on the benches (Margo in the park, and Steve in Paris Metro after visiting Louvers) observing the life around them with the different results. While Margo may say, \"My feeling's sad and light; my sorrow is bright...\" Steve's character will find out that sometimes, even the most comprehensive and useful tourist guide would not help a tourist avoiding doing the wrong things in a foreign country.\n","    for paris is a moveable feast   ernest hemingway it is impossible to count how many great talents have immortalized paris in
